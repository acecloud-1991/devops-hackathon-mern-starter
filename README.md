# DevOps Hackathon Starter â€“ MERN Social App ðŸš€

All Docker / Compose / CI files were **removed**.  
Your challenge:

1. Containerise front-end & back-end (write Dockerfiles).  
2. Create `docker-compose.yml` (or K8s) with an Nginx reverse-proxy.  
3. Secure the provided domain with Letâ€™s Encrypt.  
4. Build a CI/CD pipeline (Jenkinsfile / GitHub Actions) that tests â†’ builds â†’ pushes â†’ deploys.  

Good luck â€“ happy containerising! ðŸ”§
